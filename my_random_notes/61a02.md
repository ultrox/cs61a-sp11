;Abstraction - taking little pieces and put them together to form bigger chunks

function is relationship that has 0 or more input and always has 1 output
this makes it a function: every time you get one input you get the same output

```
sum = x => 2 * x + 6 
mus = x => 2 * (x + 3)
sum(7) // 20
mus(7) // 20
```

The same function,
--------------------
different procedure

There are function becouse fn dosent care as long as you give the same arg, and
get the same output every time.

- They behave the same way as functions

different procuders computes the same func


- Inside computere there is no functions, only procedures


## Normal & Aplicative order

What is normal order of evaluation?

You take actuall argument expression and substitute them into the body, and we
actually dont evaluate anything untill you call a primitive

Your procedure calls for herlper procedure that calles the helper that calles
plus, and thats when args gets evaluated

- Func program protect you from having to think about what going on when inside
  computer


  OO
  multiple independent intelligent agents
  - 
  - each one has its own program, runs independently, but can interact(like
    people in a room)
  - intelligent - they know how to do stuff,
  - agents rembember stuff, but know how to do stuff

# To implement:
  - message passing, local state, inheritance


OO language is trivial application of lambda???
